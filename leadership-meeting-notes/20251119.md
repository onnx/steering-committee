Leadership Meeting Agenda Discussion:

The meeting began with a discussion about the upcoming leadership meeting and the presence of key leaders like Phil and Javier. Andreas mentioned that he did not send an email for his proposal, which was intended for next week, and instead focused on a PyTorch-related question. Mayank inquired about the meeting's agenda and confirmed that Andreas would lead the discussion, with the possibility of needing more information on the PyTorch Foundation training, as Andreas was not present when Matt initially proposed it.


# ONNX's Potential PyTorch Foundation Move:

* The meeting focused on the potential move of ONNX to join the PyTorch Foundation, with mixed opinions expressed.
* Mayank shared feedback from Intel and Yamini, who supported the proposal, while Andreas raised concerns about
  losing neutrality.
* The group discussed potential benefits, such as increased visibility and access to a larger pool of contributors through the PyTorch conference, though these remained somewhat intangible.
* Ganesan emphasized the need for clear advantages, and Andreas suggested that ONNX would need to actively leverage opportunities to gain traction.
* The group agreed to seek concrete answers to their questions from the PyTorch Foundation before making a decision.

* The team discussed joining the PyTorch Foundation and its Technical Advisory Committee, with Andreas and Ganesan exploring potential benefits and interactions.
* They noted that Xavier Dupre, who is one of the SIG Arch/Infra leaders, is already part of the committee, though Ganesan expressed uncertainty about the committee's current activity level.
* The team highlighted the need to understand how ONNX would interact with other structures within the foundation, including governance bodies, working groups, and existing technical committees, before moving forward.
* The group agreed that while joining the foundation might help increase ONNX's visibility, they would need to actively engage with the community regardless of whether they leave LF AI & Data to move under the PyTorch Foundation or choose to stay.

# Steering Committee Meeting Schedule Update:

* The steering committee agreed to switch from weekly to bi-weekly meetings, with each meeting lasting approximately 30 minutes. They confirmed that the next meeting would be on December 3rd, skipping the Thanksgiving week.
* Andreas proposed forming a working group for probabilistic models in ONNX, and Rama was invited to join the steering committee meeting to discuss this.
* The committee also briefly discussed a GitHub security fund program for improving open source project security, though more details were needed before making a decision.
