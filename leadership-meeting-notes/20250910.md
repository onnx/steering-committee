#### 1) ONNX Hackathon - Saurabh

They would solicit sponsorship for the top prizes. One option can be this: [Open Source AI Week 2025 Survey](https://linuxfoundation.research.net/r/FD6JMH5) for closer engagement with pytorch ecosystem.
2) Seek time commitments from SIG leads for event responsibilities. (judging/supporting tech questions etc..).
