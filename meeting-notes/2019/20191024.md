* **ONNX Leaderboard** 
https://github.com/onnx/backend-scoreboard was written long time ago and not updated. Also difficult to add new backends.  
New version is addressed to fix those issues and also be a server-less system so it doesn't need a webservice to be hosted.  
Azure Pipelines run the jobs daily and update the results which are published to GitHub Pages.
