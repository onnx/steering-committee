### Agenda:

* **Foundation feedback** 
  Whitepaper created by Foundation WG. Emailing all workshop attendees is not needed/appropriate. Should share with Contributors. 
  Action item: Prasanth to share list of Contributors with Steering Committee.
  
* **Election process finalization**  
  Squashed and merged [election guideline draft](https://github.com/onnx/steering-committee/blob/master/election-guidelines-draft.md)
  
  Open issues:  
  How to maintain list of Contributors
  Some ideas but needs more refinement: 
  1) Whitelist known Contributors
  2) Have the whitelist Contributors endorse up to x number of developers that has contributed code to ONNX github.
  3) Whitelist the contributor when there is more than 2 endorsement from different already whitelisted Contributors 
  3) Could write a submission form and macro to query the sheet & handle confirmation

* **Topics for next week's meeting**  
* email list
* Roadmap
