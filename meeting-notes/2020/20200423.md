### Agenda:

* **Community Meetup recap**  
Thanks to Tom and the IBM team for running the event  
Joe: logistically went well; was worried about it being over zoom  
Harry: reduced time was good; people didn't have to choose between tracks  
Jim: quality, pace, # attendees were good; no side conversations that are possible in face to face meetings  
Prasanth: overall went well; agree that reduced time made speakers more focused; can have china-friendly time in a future session, don't need to find a time that kind of works for everyone but is not great for anyone  

* **LFAI TAC representative** (Prasanth)  
Though the plan was to have rotating attendence, ONNX steering committee members have not been able to attend most of the LFAI TAC meetings.  
Proposal is for Jim Spohrer to act as ONNX representative. He would report back in the regular steering committee meetings.  
Vote: Joe, Harry, Dilip, Prasanth agree

* **Steering Committee elections** (Harry)  
Candidates who applied by deadline and list of eligible contributors posted to steering committee github.
Voting starts 5/4, need to:
  * make the list of candidates visible
  * collect emails of contributors and send them announcement with voting instructions

* **ONNX 1.7 Release**  
ONNX 1.7 has been delayed due to various issues, looking like early next week for the release.  
Chin will run post mortem afterwards  
Need to ensure SIG leaders are driving. If not able to, SIG leads should be explicit and step down.  
Ensure SIGs are meeting regularly; add to LF calendar  

* **Roadmap process**  
This was the first year, so a lot of time was spent on ground work.  
Moving into second year, need to do more discussions  
Harry: allocate time to discuss roadmap once a month during TSC time, invite everyone, do pre-work  
Jim: have a shared document for people to submit ideas for roadmap
