### Agenda:

* **Community workshop** (Tom)  
Plan was to host April 16. Need to decide on virtual only event or postpone.  
Goals are for community to share accomplishments and discuss issues.  
Dilip: virtual event loses human connection that these events help with  
Joe: each sig could do a blog post and AMAs  
Harry: opportunity for TSC candidates but postponing makes sense   
   
Decision: No in-person event. Half-day moderated online-only event. Move earlier to 4/9.

* **ONNX 1.7 release** (Chin)  
Windows WHL will be built manually for now  
conda-forge decision postponed  
Still no optimizer - without it training feature won't be as useful  
Check on when it will get in - postpone release by a day or two if needed  
Everyone should read the release notes: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WTH7ueLnNSQSriW48eMRibFIPfAWtGsC/view?usp=sharing  

* **Community items**  
None
