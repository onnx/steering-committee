* Saurabh leaving Intel this week or so. SC rules say that Saurabh can continue as SC member unless he joins
  a company that has another SC member. If Saurabh steps downs and there is a vacancy in the SC, the rules
  say that the rest of the SC can nominate a replacement. The SC will discuss with Andreas to decide on what to do.

* Graiphic Proposal: The suggested email in the Slack thread sounds fine. Alex will follow up with Saurabh,
  who will send the email.

* Leadership meeting? Perhaps in september, given August vacations?

Next meeting (2025-08-13)

Moderator: Mayank
