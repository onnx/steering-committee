# ONNX PyTorch Foundation Discussion:
* Matt White (Linux Foundation, PyTorch Foundation) spoke on the topic of ONNX joining
  the PyTorch foundation.
* Matt had a question about the ORT repo https://github.com/pytorch/ort under PyTorch and
  whether it can be removed. This folder is more to to with onnxruntime and is not related
  to ONNX per se. Discussion to be continued separately between onnxruntime and Matt.
* LFAI & Data and Pytorch Foundations are sibling groups under LF. PyTorch foundation is more
  focused on Deep Learning, while LFAI is much broader
* A couple of topics were discussed in terms of what the foundation can do for ONNX. 
* One was about support (especially funding) for running ONNX anuual meetup. PyTorch Ambassador program
  runs events and sponsors events. They can provide financial support for running events.
* Second was about the Github enterprise account benefits ONNX enjoys for free for now (under LFAI).
  Matt said that the Pytorch Foundation would take care of Github costs.
* What is expected back from ONNX? If ONNX independently raises money, and asks for financial support
  from the foundation, there is some expectation. (Details?)
* TAC updates happen once a quarter
* As an umbrella project, PyTorch supports two categories:
  (a) [Foundation hosted project](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/foundation-hosted?tab=readme-ov-file). (Smaller) and
  (b) [Ecosystem project](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/ecosystem) (80).
  The barrier to entry is lower for the second, but that doesn't provide the benefits discussed above.
