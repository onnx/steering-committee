# Quick Recap #

* The main focus was on integrating probabilistic programming into ONNX to support uncertainty-aware AI models and Bayesian neural networks, with discussions about standardizing probabilistic computation across frameworks and addressing current ecosystem challenges.
* The group proposed creating three sequential working groups to define operators, handle inference pipelines, and focus on framework alignment, with plans to start with Stan as a test case before expanding to other frameworks.

Next Steps

    Brian: Share the presentation slides with the community
    Brian: Present this proposal to the Stan group at their weekly Thursday meeting
    Brian: Present this proposal to Bob Carpenter's journal club meeting on Fridays at the Flatiron Group
    Brian and team: Conduct broader community outreach to bring in framework representatives beyond just Stan
    Brian and team: Develop a roadmap defining success metrics and adoption strategy
    Brian and team: Identify potential co-chairs from different framework communities for the working group
    Brian and team: Come back to the Steering Committee beginning next year with broader community engagement and refined proposal
    Adam: Formalize the random number generator write-up and get it suitable for revising current operator specifications    
    Team: Create a pull request for the new working group formation

# Announcement: The Preprocessing Working Group is no longer active. 

* Andreas spoke with Joaquin Anton about the status of the working group and learned that it has not been active for quite some time.
* Next step: Andreas: Create a pull request to set the preprocessing working group as inactive

# Proposal of forming a new working group *Probabilistic Programming in ONNX*

## Probabilistic Programming in ONNX ##
* The meeting focused on integrating probabilistic programming into ONNX to support uncertainty-aware AI models and Bayesian neural networks.
* Brian explained the benefits of standardizing probabilistic computation across frameworks and devices, including enabling consistent portable inference and reducing framework-specific dependencies.
* The discussion highlighted challenges in the current ecosystem, such as lack of standard internal representations and inconsistencies in random number generation semantics.
* The proposed solution involves creating a universal runtime for Bayesian inference in ONNX, which would align with ONNX's existing strengths and complement its GenAI strategy.

## Bayesian Model Deployment Challenges:
* The discussion focused on the current state of deploying Bayesian inference models, where Brian explained that different frameworks like Stan, PyMC, and Pyro have their own unique model formats and deployment mechanisms, making it difficult to standardize the process.
* Alexandre suggested that ONNX's success comes from its ability to serve as a common format that can be used across platforms and maintain stability as an archiving structure, though he questioned whether existing models could be translated to ONNX without requiring recreation from scratch.

## Probabilistic Model Framework Porting Challenges:
* The discussion focused on challenges in porting probabilistic models between different frameworks, with Brian highlighting efforts at IBM to standardize models between Stan, Pyro, and NumPyro. 
* He noted that while there are attempts to create standardized approaches, reproducibility remains difficult across different frameworks, particularly when moving models between R and Python environments.
* The conversation also touched on the lack of a centralized platform like Hugging Face for sharing probabilistic models, which could limit their deployment and reuse in commercial settings.

## ONNX Probabilistic Modeling Initiative:
* The group discussed improving ONNX operators for reproducibility and standardization, particularly in random number generation and probabilistic inference. 
* Brian proposed creating working groups to define ONNX infrastructure support for probabilistic modeling, including operators, runtime constraints, and cross-framework compatibility.
* They aim to position probabilistic inference as a first-class ONNX workload, complementary to Gen AI and deep learning, with a focus on marketing data science applications.
* The group plans to maintain a canonical set of distributions, bijectors, and special functions, while publishing reference implementations for CPU and CUDA.

## ONNX Probabilistic Framework Integration Plan:
* The meeting focused on a proposal to create three sequential working groups for integrating probabilistic programming frameworks into ONNX.
* Brian and Adam outlined how the first working group would define operators and functions, the second would handle inference pipelines, and the third would focus on framework alignment and exporters.
* They emphasized that each working group's deliverables would be independently useful, with the first group enabling model deployment across different environments.
* The team discussed the need for community buy-in, particularly from Stan and other probabilistic programming communities, and agreed to start with Stan as a test case before expanding to other frameworks.
* The group also touched on improving random number generators in ONNX and the need for formalizing operator specifications.
