#### TAC presentation ####
- TAC wants a 15 minute presentation with 5 mins slides and 10 mins demo (June 5th @ 6am Pacific Time)
- Krishna had volunteered TurnKey demo.
- Alex presented the slide and got a lot of useful feedback, and will post a new set within an hour of the meeting.

#### ONNX 2.0 discussion ####
- Discussion originating from the presentation on what we should present for the push toward ONNX 2.0
- Mayank: pytorch is important but ONNX is small lightweight and has a lot of value, big benefits to embedded in smaller / robotics... with c++ env.
  Convergeance with pytorch is key.
- Saurabh: more focus on the focus on conversion from pytorch. Fastest way to production is through ONNX.
- Rama: there is still a value in going out of pytorch for traing to deployment.
- Saurabh: how do you see us distingish from A10 and executor (meta executor, export out of pytorch into executor).
- Rama: benefit from open standard is significant for companies.
- Andreas: easy and stable depoyment. Machine model in critical environemnt (medical, plane,...) need suitable well defined.
- Mayank: take strenght (large installment base, well known) and cross platform (microsoft offerings) and leverage existing strenght and update for genai and other topics of importance.
- Saurabh: operators (fine) and framework (olama, vllm), see that ONNX is not that relevant in server labs, now more client centered, is that ok
- Mayank: olama is also only client side. Still a gap on windows. There is still a gap special process good topic for discussion with the larger community.
- Alex: GenAI WG discussed this today, and initial goal is to converge interfaces for client side, with an eye towards server side in the future.


#### Meetup ####
- discussion on ONNX 2.0 is helpful to guide the discussions
  - Mayank: steering committee talk should be no more than 10-12 min
  - Rama: found a gap, Saurabh to fix the schedule.
- Saurabh: we can make the 9-9:30 a networking time. 

#### PyTorch talk
- Saurabh proposed that ONNX submit a talk to the PyTorch conference (Oct 22-23 in SF)
- Saurabh submitted 2 lighting talk. If someone know someone in the PyTorch conference.
- Andreas: PyTorch also has open meetings that we can join.
- Saurabh: wish they have ways to better interact with PyTorch, and Amazon was very active with ONNX, and so was Apple.
- Krishnan: Amazon does use ONNX a lot, but they not as active in the community anymore.
- Rama: Facebook is only pytorch.
- Mayank: with torch inductor, pytorch has now a common path between ONNX exporter. That is a good development.

#### Next meeting (2025-06-11)
 - Moderator: Mayank
