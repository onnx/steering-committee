Funding Support: 
* Options for raising money? Model Zoo migrating to HF. What if HF starts charging?
* Moving into a member-company owned github repo (like onnxruntime) is one possibility.
* Can we charge a membership fee? Or, sponsorship (optional)?
* Evangelism (like LF conferences/events) to promote ONNX?
* Can we look an analogous project, to see what has worked? Pytorch, OCP are not?

Graiphic Proposal:
* What are they expecting from the ONNX community?
* Their participation is very welcome. They are open to create and implement ops in their
  own custom domain.
* It is not clear yet what is the synergy between current ONNX (high level) and the low
  level ops being proposed.
* Action item: draft a proposed response to them. Alex offered to do an initial draft.
