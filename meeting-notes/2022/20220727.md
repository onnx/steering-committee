### Agenda:
  
  #### Ongoing community outreach and talks
  - Alex found an ONNX tutorial off the onnx.ai page, it wasn't particularly easy to find
    - Alex will attempt to create one for ONNX-mlir
    - Tutorials are maintained by the Tutorials and Model SIG
    - Tutorials are linked off Get Started. Most tutorials are about export
  - Andreas demo'd his video page: https://andife.github.io/onnxvideo.github.io/index.html
    - The current YouTube playlist makes videos a bit harder to find
    - Andreas' interface looks good, we'd also like the option to display videos on other platforms besides YouTube for folks in China
    - We've decided to move forward with this. We'll reuse the pyvideo template to generate these pages.

  #### ONNX Training
  - Looking for pointers on fine tuning an ONNX model
   - onnx-runtime supports training / pre-training / fine-tuning
 
  #### Next meeting (8/03)
  - Moderator: TBD
