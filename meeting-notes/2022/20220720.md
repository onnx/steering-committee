| Rajeev Nalawadi (Intel)         | yes   |
| Andreas Fehlner (TRUMPF Laser)  | yes   |

Others: Bhargavi

### Agenda:
  
  #### Ongoing community outreach and talks
  - Alex working on FAQ for specific info on ONNX projects
  - Andreas has ideas of bringing links / videos from other adjacency projects (eg: Pyvideo). Will assess further based on Youtube links already available 
  - JSON / metadata / keywords information that Pyvideo adopts and useful for promoting ONNX, currently doesn't have ONNX related info, Andreas will share in coming week
  
  #### Help with ONNX SIGS
  - Mayank (nVidia) & Rajeev (Intel) have identified few participants from respective companies for SIGs.
  - Prasanth has invited folks from Qualcomm to join
  - Alex attended converters / operators SIG and saw it needs more participation
  - Eg: Operators SIG trying to remove / deprecate older operators. Dependencies exist for converters & runtimes implementation. Suggested declartions to make this more transparent 
  - Older opsets being deprecated. More followup requested from SIG chairs.

  #### Neural compressor tool for ONNX 
  -  Bhargavi presented the proposal of neural compressor tool as contribution to ONNX repo
  -  Github tracker with FAQ's from previous discussions-- https://github.com/onnx/steering-committee/issues/52
  -  Tool is available for generating ONNX quantized / mixed precision / sparsity & pruned models
  -  INC has high popularity among ONNX community
  -  Has been integrated into Huggingface Optimum pipeline
  -  INC tool also used to contribute towards ONNX model Zoo offerings
  -  Tool generates ONNX model with compliant operators and can be fine tuned for varied hardware offerings
  -  (Alex): Is the tool using any converters internally (either standalone or native) ? 
  -  (Alex & Andreas): Can we provide a Tensorflow / Pytorch / Mxnet model to the tool & have it directly generate an ONNX model ?
  -  (Alex): In the process of contributing to ONNX repo (eg: ONNX MLIR project from IBM), the team is planning to showcase "Z platform" as one of the accelerator instances, is this similar with INC tool where other IHV's can add their optimized capabilities ?
  -  Next steps: Address the questions in github FAQ and will approach in future ONNX SC meeting for approval to proceed further with tool migration to ONNX repo  
      
  #### Next meeting (7/27)
  - Moderator: Mayank
