### Agenda:

  #### Hugging Face Spaces and auto conversion to ONNX (Felix from HF)
  - Building an auto-converter into Spaces to convert from Pytorch & Tensorflow models to ONNX
  - The hub has 86K models (50K Pytorch, 5K tensorflow, 384 ONNX)
  - The autoconvert mechanism on spaces will allow more ONNX models to be propagated
  - Optimuum library allows the usage of ONNX models through ONNX runtime with same transformers API library
  - Export feature on hub being explored for transformers (ONNX, CoreML, TFlite etc..)
  - HF Spaces is an easy way to showcase 
  - How does converted ONNX model gets tested ?
  - How is revisioning of models tracked ?
  - How do we ensure scalebaility of models with varying Opsets ?
