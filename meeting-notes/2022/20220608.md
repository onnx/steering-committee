    - Prasanth requested info for making presentation. Gives us a hard deadline for 6/15 for ideas with sketches of slides. Rajeev will start a draft.
    - We do have a YouTube channel that is a bit unsorted. To better structure the videos so that it is easier to locate. Pydata is more structured. Andreas to make suggestions.

 #### Help with ONNX PR monitoring
  - Need to encourage more people to be maintainers/approvers for managing PRs
    - Arch, infra and operators have lots of pending PRs.
  - Participating companies should nominate people for these roles
  - People who have given presented in the past would be good candidates
  - SIG leads/steering committee members could come up with proposals
    - Mayank to send email to SIG leads asking for maintainer nominations
    - All SC members to look for volunteer maintainers within their companies
  - tabled for next week.
  
 #### Make video a bit more promeminent as GitHub/Web pages
  - Andreas: suggest to have more web/github presence.
    - Other communities have open/office hours, we could use it.
    - SIG is more technical, could have these for how to use, what is possible, what are limitations
      - interested in ONNX, how can we jump in. 
  
  #### Next meeting (6/15)
  - Moderator: Mayank
