#### Notes
* PyTorch foundatio
  - Summary of Andreas' email exchange with Matt White:
    - It seems possible to become a PyTorch ecosystem project (without giving up our home LFAI&Data)
    - But that does not give us the benefits we want
    - Before becoming a Foundation Level project,  we need to meet the OpenSSF Best Practices Silver
      badge requirement, which we don't currently.
    - Improving the security aspects seems worthwhile, but needs some investigation on what is required.

* Roadmap proposals
  - Should we call for 2026 roadmap proposals?
  - What should the scope be?
  - Makes sense to have one
  - AI: Agnes will work with Andreas on call-for-proposals

* Roadmap for tf2onnx (Ian Riley)
