## Quick Recap
The meeting focused on security issues and repository maintenance for the ONNX project. The group discussed GitHub security vulnerabilities and agreed to have Microsoft review these issues. They also addressed the need to rename the leadership meeting to be more inclusive and discussed the possibility of joining the PyTorch Foundation. The team reviewed their progress toward the OpenSSF Silver badge and debated how to address various security best practices. They scheduled the next leadership meeting for April 22nd and decided that the Steering Committee would vote on whether to pursue foundation-level project status. The conversation ended with a brief discussion about repository maintenance and AI contribution policies, which was scheduled as a topic for the next meeting.

## Next Steps:

* Mayank: Send 2-3 sentences to Andreas (via Slack) summarizing ONNX's handling of security issues related to inputs and dependencies, for inclusion in the security assurance case document.
* Andreas: Add Mayank's provided text to the security assurance case document for the ONNX repository.
* Ganesan: Check with relevant contacts about the status and process for upgrading the ONNX GitHub organization to an Enterprise account and report back.
* Andreas: Schedule the next ONNX SIG/leadership/community meeting for April 22 and ensure the agenda includes discussion of joining the PyTorch Foundation.
* Steering Committee: At the next meeting, discuss and vote on whether ONNX should join the PyTorch Foundation, with decision to be made by majority vote (after the leadership meeting April 22)
* Ganesan/Andreas/Relevant Team: Review and update the contributing documentation to include sentences about security expectations and CI checks for code contributions.
* Andreas/Ganesan/Team: Add discussion of repository maintenance, AI-generated code policies, and guidelines for safety to the agenda of the next meeting.

## Agenda

### (1. Proposal to create "Equivalent Subgraph Working Group" *(Javier)*)
- Topic will be integrated to the GenAI working group

---

### 2. Security Issue Response Process for onnx/onnx *(Andreas)*

**Background:**  
* Current handling of security-related GitHub issues in onnx/onnx is inconsistent — some issues partially addressed, no systematic process, slow response times, no clear ownership.
* No clear security expert 

Outcome: Microsoft has agreed to provide security review support.

### 3. Next Leadership Meeting – When? *(Andreas)*
- 22th April?
- Community Feedback on the Meeting Name:The term "Leadership Meeting" may unintentionally signal exclusivity, discouraging broader participation from SIG and WG contributors. Should we rename it to something more inviting — e.g. "ONNX Community Call" or "ONNX Contributor Meeting"? If so, should we also formally broaden the invitation to all active contributors?
- Technical issues within LFX has to be solved (not everyone got an invite)

Outcome: 22th April, new name: "ONNX Cross-SIG & WG Sync"

### 4. PyTorch Foundation discussion: (Andreas)
* Improving security posture is also a prerequisite for meeting the **OpenSSF Best Practices Silver Badge**, which is required before ONNX could become a PyTorch Foundation Level project.
* The team discussed two main topics: a potential foundation-level project and OpenSSF Best Practices silver badge requirements. Andreas shared that several votes from the PyTorch ecosystem have been received, but the Steering Committee needs to decide whether to make a foundation-level project decision themselves or delegate it to working group leads. Regarding the silver badge, Andreas presented a security assurance case document for review, which Ganesan was added to review, and Alexandre suggested comparing it to other LFAI organizations' silver badge requirements.

### 4. Mail from LF AI&Data: "Q1 Pipeline Updates – ONNX Project" *(Andreas)*
- Who is responding?
- Any open items or blockers to communicate?

---

### 5. PyTorch Foundation *(Andreas)*

**Summary of email exchange with Matt White:**
- Becoming a **PyTorch Ecosystem Project**, which is possible without leaving LF AI&Data, is on the way. See here: https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/ecosystem/issues/56#issuecomment-3889683544 . But does not provide the benefits we are seeking
- Becoming a **Foundation Level Project** requires meeting **OpenSSF Best Practices Silver Badge** (currently not met; We are making progress (95%, but we are not there yet.), further points needed where addressed
  - for example: https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/7679

**Open decisions:**
- Who votes on becoming a Foundation Level project — Steering Committee only, or including SIG and WG Leads?
- When do we want the decision? *(was proposed for 2026-02-11 leadership meeting — revisit timing)*

### 7. tf2onnx, Repository Maintenance & AI Contributions in github.com/onnx (Andreas)
Andreas has heavily reworked the tf2onnx repository and created an RC1, but the effort was significantly larger than expected — and it only covered removing completely deprecated code and fixing broken pipelines, without yet addressing newer Python or TensorFlow versions. The repository currently supports Python 3.10 and TensorFlow 2.13–2.15, while the current TensorFlow release is already 2.20. As Andreas is no longer a heavy TensorFlow user himself, community support is needed to move forward. This discussion also surfaced a broader question: several other repositories within the onnx GitHub organization — including digestai, neural-compressor, turnkeyml, and backend-scoreboard — show reduced activity, and adding dependabot.yml files confirmed that most CI pipelines are not running reliably. One idea is to leverage AI tooling to help sustain these repositories — yet ONNX has no formal position on AI-assisted contributions, despite already using such tools heavily in practice. Should the Steering Committee address this gap and define a policy on AI contributions?


### 8. RFC Process and Template Review (Christian)
  - Alex to send previous years' survey to Christian for additional in-depth query questions
  - Survey can be one-two step (first to identify pain points, second to assess priority)
  - Propose to use 2nd day in the next meetup to share ideas and proposals
  - PR template in GH for "roadmap proposals", PR provides structure and merge allows for record keeping

## Notes / Decisions




### Agenda
* Proposal to create "Equivalent Subgraph Working Group" (Javier)
* Security Issue Response Process for onnx/onnx (Andreas)
* Next Leadership Meeting, When? (Andreas)
  
* Mail from LF AI&Data: "Q1 Pipeline Updates - ONNX Project" (Andreas)
  * Who is answering?   

* PyTorch foundation (Andreas)
  - Go ahead with the application as an ecosystem project? Anyone opposed?
  - Who should ultimately vote on whether we want to become a Foundation Level project? Just the Steering Committee? Or the Steering Committee and SIG and WG Leads?
  - When do we want the decision?
    - At the next leadership meeting on February 11th, 2026. Majority voting?
  - Summary of Andreas' email exchange with Matt White:
    - It seems possible to become a PyTorch ecosystem project (without giving up our home LFAI&Data)
    - But that does not give us the benefits we want
    - Before becoming a Foundation Level project,  we need to meet the OpenSSF Best Practices Silver
      badge requirement, which we don't currently.
    - Improving the security aspects seems worthwhile, but needs some investigation on what is required.
