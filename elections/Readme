# SC election (Logistics)

The election guidelines could be found here: https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/community/sc-election-guidelines.md

## Collection of Candidates
We use microsoft forms to collect the candidates list: https://forms.office.com/r/FGq98e9QnW  

(Google forms are not accesible from China)

## Collection the of votes
For collect the votes we use https://civs1.civs.us (is available from China)

Other option: 
* http://opavote.com/ seems to be more user-friendly but it is not accesible from China...
* We could still use it, as the "votes" are open, we can ask the voters directly for the votes and add it to the list
