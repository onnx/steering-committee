|Christian Bourjau|QuantCo|QuantCo has depended on ONNX in key projects for over three years. Over this time, QuantCo and I have contributed extensively to ONNX and its community. This includes contributions to the onnx and onnxruntime repositories. We also initiated various open-source efforts that significantly improve the user experience when writing converter code (https://github.com/Quantco/spox, https://github.com/Quantco/ndonnx). We (and I) continue to present ONNX and our tooling at various Python meetups and conferences across Europe. Lastly, I am also a maintainer for various ONNX-related conda-forge packages (onnx, onnxruntime, skl2onnx, spox, ndonnx). In the position of a steering committee member, I would love to contribute our perspective as a (primarily European) SME, and furthermore, work towards my vision for ONNX to become the de facto serialization standard in machine learning. Working towards this goal poses various challenges. I believe that we as a community must address some long-standing issues, such as an inherent dependence on Protobuf and the lack of any fully standard-compliant runtime in the ecosystem. Such changes are not only technically challenging but furthermore require good ecosystem-wide communication, making the steering committee the ideal platform.|
|Rajeev Patwari|AMD|I am passionate about accelerating generative AI inference and training. Over the past 2 years, I have been technically leading this effort at AMD. I am now motivated to be a part of larger ONNX community to drive innovation and adoption.|
|Saurabh Tangri|Intel Corporation|Since the beginning of ONNX, I've been deeply involved in its growth, working tirelessly to broaden its reach by collaborating with many companies and onboarding contributors from both small and large corporations. Recently, I championed the next wave of ONNX evolution targeting needs of generative AI(gen-ai). I have proposed the formation of a Gen AI WG that has brought collaborators across industry to drive addition of missing gen-ai pipeline elements into ONNX. I also want to address the velocity of ONNX builds as it is often lagging significantly behind in its standardization efforts and has caused an explosion of custom operator libraries. Besides chairing/contributing to Windows Copilot Runtime and ONNX Runtime, my team at Intel chairs model zoo SIG and optimization SIG. In the past I spearheaded Intel's donation of Intel’s Neural Compressor and formation of optimization SIG. The optimization SIG especially is expected to see increased activity next year as we prepare to onboard ONNXscript and greater proliferation of ONNX functions. As a current member of the ONNX steering committee, I've fostered collaboration across different LFAI initiatives, which has included co-chairing different Gen AI Commons workstreams in past. I envision ONNX as more than a format for interoperability across AI frameworks, I see ONNX as extremely important to bridge what gets created in Pytorch and what hardware vendors can support for efficient execution. Looking ahead, I'm committed to making the ONNX ecosystem the top choice for building and deploying efficient, cutting-edge, trusted, and secure AI solutions in rapidly evolving AI landscape. Next year my hope is to ensure that we address the ecosystem feedback about gen-ai scenarios and lack of ONNX relevance when it comes to gen-ai. The export path from Pytorch needs special focus if want to expand on ONNX adoption in the ecosystem. With your support, I'm eager to continue driving ONNX forward and shape it future!|
